# Project Evaluations 


## Instructions 

In this activity you will evaluate an open source project.

You should be working in groups of 2-3 students.


__Step 1:__ Pick a project from the list below. You are not commited to that project, so the choice does not really matter too much, but you should form small groups around the projects. Multiple groups can evaluate a single project, if there is interest in it.

__Step 2:__ Create a new file in this repository and copy the template from the `project_evaluation.md` into it.
You should name the file by replacing the word "project" in the template by the name of the project you are looking at. 
(If there are more than one group working on a particular project, then you should append an integer to the end of 
the file name, ex. `_1.md` or `_3.md`

__Step 3:__ Add an entry on the course wiki _Project Evaluation_ page listing the name of the project and the link to your
evaluation. You should list the names of your group that is evaluating this project. 

__Step 4:__ Answer all the questions in the template based on the information on the project website and in 
the project repository (DO NOT use a search engine!!!).
